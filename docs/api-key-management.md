# API Key Management System

## Overview

The API Key Management System is a comprehensive solution for securely storing, testing, and managing third-party AI service provider credentials within the Deep Parallel AI platform. This system allows users to integrate external AI services seamlessly into the thought-to-visual pipeline.

## Supported Providers

The system currently supports the following AI service providers:

- **OpenAI** - For GPT models and DALL-E image generation
- **Anthropic** - For Claude models and text analysis
- **Mistral AI** - For Mistral language models
- **DeepInfra** - For image and video generation models
- **Perplexity** - For search-augmented generation
- **Runway** - For advanced video generation
- **Together AI** - For open-source model hosting

## Architecture

### Backend Components

1. **API Provider Management**
   - Database schema for storing provider metadata
   - Provider initialization and configuration
   - Provider capability tracking

2. **API Key Storage**
   - Secure storage of API keys with sensitive data protection
   - Key preview with masking for UI display
   - Association with user accounts and providers

3. **API Key Testing**
   - Automated verification of API key validity
   - Provider-specific testing endpoints
   - Validation status tracking and reporting

4. **RESTful API Endpoints**
   - List available providers
   - Add, remove, and test API keys
   - Get provider status with key information

### Frontend Components

1. **Provider Status Dashboard**
   - Visual overview of available providers
   - Current API key status for each provider
   - Quick actions for key management

2. **API Key Management Interface**
   - Add new API keys with provider selection
   - View and manage existing API keys
   - Test API key validity on demand

3. **Security Features**
   - API key masking (only partial keys visible)
   - Secure form submission
   - Permission-based access control

## User Flow

1. User navigates to the API Keys page via the sidebar
2. The system displays provider cards showing available AI services
3. For each provider, users can:
   - View current key status (Valid, Invalid, Not Configured)
   - Add a new API key
   - Test existing keys
   - Remove keys
4. When adding a key, users:
   - Select a provider
   - Name the key (for reference)
   - Enter the API key
   - Submit for validation

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

The system uses two primary tables:

- `api_providers` - Stores metadata about supported providers
- `api_keys` - Stores user API keys with security measures

### Key Testing Logic

For each provider, the system implements specialized testing logic that:

1. Makes minimal API calls to verify key validity
2. Uses appropriate authentication methods
3. Handles error responses correctly
4. Updates key status based on test results

### Security Considerations

- API keys are never returned to the frontend in full
- All API endpoints require authentication
- User permissions are verified for key operations
- Keys are stored securely

## Extending the System

To add support for a new provider:

1. Add provider metadata to the default providers list
2. Implement a test function for validating keys
3. Add provider logo and UI components
4. Register the provider's capabilities

## Integration with Pipeline

The API Key Management System integrates with the thought-to-visual pipeline by:

1. Providing access to validated API credentials at runtime
2. Enabling fallback mechanisms between providers
3. Supporting graceful error handling when services are unavailable
4. Facilitating user-defined service preferences

## Future Enhancements

- Usage tracking and quota management
- Provider performance analytics
- Cost optimization suggestions
- Advanced key rotation policies
